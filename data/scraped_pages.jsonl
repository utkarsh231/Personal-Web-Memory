If you\u2019d like to take a break without losing recordings that you\u2019ve saved, you can also pause your membership for up to 6 months. Ads Does YouTube TV have ads? Yes. The live TV programming comes from networks similar to traditional TV broadcasts, so many of the networks we offer have ad breaks. When YouTube videos are shown on YouTube TV, the majority of the ad revenue from them will support the creators of those videos. Can I fast-forward through ads? Depending on how you watch, you\u2019ll be able to skip some ads. Live TV As with traditional TV, you can't fast-forward through ads while watching live TV. But if you pause a show, you can fast-forward until you catch up to the live version. DVR You can typically fast-forward through ads on recorded programs once they\u2019ve aired on live TV. On demand Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. Typically you can\u2019t fast-forward through ads while watching on-demand content. If you've recorded something that's also available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on-demand version will be played back instead of your recording. YouTube videos If you're a YouTube Premium member, you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you\u2019re not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium? YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with major broadcast and popular cable networks. YouTube Premium gives you YouTube and YouTube Music ad-free, offline, and in the background. YouTube Premium isn\u2019t included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch YouTube content on YouTube TV without ads. Add-Ons What premium networks can I add to my membership? YouTube TV has a wide variety of premium add-ons like HBO Max, Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, and MGM+ to help you build out your dream TV experience. They\u2019re available at an additional charge, but many of them offer free trials for new users. How do I add premium networks?
